Added `Ed25519` and `X25519` cryptographic modules for modern elliptic curve operations. The `Ed25519` module provides functionality for creating key pairs, signing messages, and verifying signatures using the Ed25519 signature scheme. The `X25519` module enables Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement operations for secure shared secret derivation between parties.
